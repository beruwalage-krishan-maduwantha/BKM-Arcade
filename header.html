            <h2>üë®‚Äçüíª About Us</h2>
            <p>
                BKM Arcade was founded and developed by <strong>Krishan Maduwantha Beruwalage</strong>, a dedicated and passionate undergraduate student pursuing HD Software Engineering at the prestigious <strong>Cardiff Metropolitan University</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Driven by a deep love for both classic gaming culture and modern web technologies, Krishan envisioned BKM Arcade as more than just a gaming platform - it's a bridge between the nostalgic charm of retro arcade games and the accessibility of contemporary web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mission extends beyond entertainment: we aim to create an inclusive, educational, and open-source-driven digital space where developers can learn, players can enjoy premium gaming experiences, and communities can thrive. Every game, feature, and interaction is crafted with attention to detail, user experience, and technical excellence.
